## Description

Behold! A magical crystal ball that will reveal your fortune with a wave of your hand (a click of your mouse)! Or will it? I dunno, I'm kinda new to this. Pretty sure I ordered a functional crystal ball... Anyway, just wave your hand (mouse) around the ball to power it up, then tap (click) on it to conjure up your fortune (hope that's what it is)!

*PLEASE NOTE* I originally intended to also make the ball shake when the mouse hovered over the ball to add to the experience, but I got ahead on this a bit too late to troubleshoot (code wasn't working). I left the code there to get back to it eventually. If I had extra extra time, I would've also tried to add a glow when the mouse approached the ball for *extra* effect.

## Credits

This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

I used a sample of code from Pippin's "random() and probability" example seen in the Conditionals module : https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/sketches/8NkxcrJsi.

A big thank you to Mathilde for helping me!
