/**
 * Crystal Ball
 * Mary Dedes
 * 
 * Behold! A magical crystal ball that will reveal your fortune 
 * with a wave of your hand (a click of your mouse)! Or will it? 
 * I dunno, I'm kinda new to this. Pretty sure I ordered
 * a functional crystal ball... Anyway, just wave your 
 * hand (mouse) around the ball to power it up, 
 * then tap (click) on it to conjure up your fortune 
 * (hope that's what it is)!
 * 
 * 
 * PLEASE NOTE* I originally intended to also make the ball 
 * shake when the mouse hovered over the ball to add to the experience, 
 * but I got ahead on this a bit too late to troubleshoot 
 * (code wasn't working). I left the code there to get back to it 
 * eventually. If I had extra extra time, 
 * I would've also tried to add a glow when the mouse 
 * approached the ball for *extra* effect. In time!
