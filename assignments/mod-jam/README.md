# Frog Prince

Once upon a time there was a prince whose life got turned upside down afer being transformed into a frog by a vengeful wizard. Now, he is not only forced to *earn* his living- devastating- but he must also be one with nature... oh the hu/frog/man/non-prince/ity(?)! Now he must spend the rest of his days just like any regular ol' frog- catching coins to satisfy his money hunger (and to buy flies) and dodging anti-wealth curses before starving to death. Will he ever escape this miserable existence?? Will he ever get his happily ever after?? *Can* he???? Maybe you can help! By maybe I mean you definitely are going to help. To help this spoiled frog prince who probably deserves all this, simply:

 - Move the frog left by pressing the right arrow key, and right by pressing the left arrow key (the wizard cursed the keys too, good luck)
 - Press the up arrow to launch the tongue and catch coins (pretty intuitive)
 - Press the spacebar to jump - press the left arrow key right after to leap over the floating anti-wealth curse
 - Collect 10 coins before a minute runs out or he'll starve to death and it will be your fault. Not mine- I mean the wizard's.
 - If you successfully collect enough coins, our frog lives, but he must properly manage his finances or else...
   
*NOTE* The next step would've been to add fun images to better illustrate what is going on. This would have made it look more polished. As new ideas about the concept popped up while I worked, I just prioritized making sure the basic program worked well at least. 

Thank you to Sabine, Mathilde and Pippin for helping me!
