/**
 * Hungry Hungry Frog Prince
 * 
 * Once upon a time there was a prince whose life got turned
 * upside down afer being transformed into a frog by a vengeful wizard. 
 * Now, he is not only forced to *earn* his living- devastating- 
 * but he must also be one with nature... oh the hu/frog/man/non-prince/ity(?)! 
 * 
 * Now he must spend the rest of his days just like any regular ol' frog-
 * catching coins to buy flies and dodging anti-wealth curses before starving 
 * to death.
 * 
 * Will he ever escape this miserable existence?? Will he ever get his
 * happily ever after??? 
 * 
 * *Can* he????
 * 
 * Maybe you can help! By maybe I mean you definitely are going to help.
 * 
 * To help this spoiled frog prince who probably deserves all this, simply:
 * 
 * - Move the frog left by pressing the right arrow key, and right by pressing 
 *   the left arrow key (the wizard cursed the keys too, good luck)
 * - Press the up arrow to launch the tongue and catch coins (pretty intuitive)
 * - Press the spacebar to jump - press the left arrow key right after
 *   to leap over the floating anti-wealth curse 
 * - Collect 10 coins before time runs out or he'll starve to death 
 *   and it will be your fault. Not mine- I mean the wizard's.
